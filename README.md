I am a trained Physical Design Engineer with hands-on experience gained through a six-month training program at RV Skills Design Center. My focus lies in the full ASIC Physical Design flow, with practical knowledge in floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), routing, and static timing analysis (STA), and I am familiar with industry-standard EDA tools such as Synopsys ICC2 and PrimeTime.

I hold a B.Tech (2020-2024) in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a specialization in AIML from GITAM University.

Passionate about chip design and excited to contribute to the semiconductor industry. I am currently seeking entry-level opportunities in Physical Design, VLSI, or related areas, where I can apply and further grow my skills.
